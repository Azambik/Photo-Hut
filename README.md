   ## Installation
   *Steps on how to install:*  
   Using Node.js, use 

   ## Usage
   *Instructions for use with examples:*  
   The design of Photo Hut is to allow professional photographers to connect and collaborate in a space devoted to their art, instead of an endless pursuit of 'likes' and linking hashtags on their photos. Users create an account that allows them to create a profile with their business information and LinkedIn account. Then, they can upload their photos with captions with an option to pin their favorite at the top and reorder the photos according to their own design. Using the Search function, users can browse other profiles, commenting and upvoting. This collaboration allows photographers to follow trends in their community by popularity and gather tips and tricks from others.

   ## Contributing
   *The ins and outs of how to contribute.*  
   To contribute to the future development of this site, please reach out directly to Andrew Zambik, 'Azambik' on GitHub to gain access to the workflow and be added to the queue for ongoing enhancements.

   ## Tests
   *Run these tests to showcase the application.*  
   For tests through Jest, run 'npm run test' to test helper utilities. Further, as our userbase isn't at an optimal number yet, you must create and seed the database. To do so, use mysql to run 'source schema.sql;' then exit with 'quit;'. Now, you can seed the site with the dummy data we've provided. Use 'npm run seed' in the terminal to add the data.
